# chatbot_with_gpt2
This repository is for building Japanese chatbot by fine-tuning gpt-2, especially by one of rinna models.

## Environment
I checked if it works well only on google colab whose python version is 3.7.12.

## Quickstart
I published an article about how to use this repository on dev.to [[My own chatbot by fine-tuning GPT-2](https://dev.to/ksk0629/my-own-chatbot-by-fine-tuning-gpt-2-m0n)]. We could build our own chatbots by following the steps in the article.
